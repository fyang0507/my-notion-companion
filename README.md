# My Notion Companion ðŸ¤–
###### A conversational RAG that helps to chat with my (mostly Chinese-based) Notion Databases.

My Notion Companion is a LLM-powered conversational RAG to chat with documents from Notion.
It uses hybrid search (lexical + semantic) search to find the relevant documents and a chat interface to interact with the docs.
It uses only **open-sourced technologies** and can **run on a single Mac Mini**.


### Empowering technologies
- **The Framework**: uses [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/)
- **The LLM**: uses ðŸ¤—-developed [`HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta`](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta). It has great inference speed, bilingual and instruction following capabilities
- **The Datastores**: the documents were stored into both conventional lexical data form and embeeding-based vectorstore (uses [Redis](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/redis))
- **The Embedding Model**: uses [`sentence-transformers/distiluse-base-multilingual-cased-v1`](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/distiluse-base-multilingual-cased-v1). It has great inference speed and bilingual capability
- **The Tokenizers**: uses ðŸ¤—'s [`AutoTokenizer`](AutoTokenizer) and Chinese text segmentation tool [`jieba`](https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba) (only in lexical search)
- **The Lexical Search Tool**: uses [`rank_bm25`](https://github.com/dorianbrown/rank_bm25)
- **The Computing**: uses [LlamaCpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) to power the LLM in the local machine (a Mac Mini with M2 Pro chip)
- **The Observability Tool**: uses [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/)
- **The UI**: uses [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/)

### What's wrong with Notion's native search?
As much as I've been a very loyal (but freemium) Notion user, search func in Notion **sucks**. It supports only discrete keyword search with exact match (e.g. it treats Taylor Swift as two words).

What's even worse is that most of my documents are in Chinese. Most Chinese words consist of multiple characters. If you break them up, you end up with a total different meaning ("ä¸Šæµ·"=Shanghai, "ä¸Š"=up,"æµ·"=ocean).

My Notion Compnion is here to help me achieve two things:
- to have an improved search experience across my notion databases (200+ documents)
- to have a conversation with my Notion documents in natural language

#### The E2E Pipeline

- When a user enters a prompt, the assistant will try lexical search first
  - a query analyzer will analyze the query and extract keywords (for search) and domains (for metadata filtering)
  - the extracted domains will be compared against the metadata of documents, only those with a matched metadata will be retrieved
  - the keyword will be segmented into searchable tokens, then further compared against the metadata-filtered documents with BM25 lexical search algorithm
  - The fetched documents will be subject to a final match checker to ensure relevance
- If lexical search doesn't return enough documents, the assistant will then try semantic search into the Redis vectorstore. Retrieved docs will also subject the QA by match checker.
- All retrieved documents will be sent to LLM as part of a system prompt, the LLM will then act as a conversational RAG to chat with the user with knowledges from the provided documents
