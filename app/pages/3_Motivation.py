As much as I've been a very loyal (but freemium) Notion user, search func in Notion **sucks**. It supports only discrete keyword search with exact match (e.g. it treats Taylor Swift as two words).

What's even worse is that most of my documents are in Chinese. Most Chinese words consist of
multiple characters. If you break them up, you end up with a total different meaning ("ä¸Šæµ·"=Shanghai, "ä¸Š"=up,"æµ·"=ocean).
